## General Information
You work for a consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
1.If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
2.If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
3.The data given contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. 
4.The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Conclusions
Based on the Analysis done on the Variables, we conclude the below mentioned points :-
Small Business Applicants have high chances of getting charged off.    
Those who are not working or have less than 1 year of work experience have high chances of getting charged off.
The loan amounts are bigger on average for small business purpose among all purposes of Loan.
Average interest rate is considerably higher for 60 months loan term than 36 months.
Ones getting charged off have lower annual incomes than the ones who has fully paid for each and every grade.

Suggestions to Lending Club:
Loans for Small Business Applicants should be checked properly.
Loan approval for Low quality loans should be avoided or given for smaller loan repayment term.
Lower annual income applicants should be avoided for big loan amounts with higher interest Rates.
Loan approval should be avoided for applicants who  doesn’t have a source of income.
